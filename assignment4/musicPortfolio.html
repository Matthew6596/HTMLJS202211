                    <h2>Title of Song</h2>
                    <p>This song is relativley quick and a bit chaotic. I'm most proud of the bass piano part and the slightly unstable feeling I managed to generate. The making of this song was interesting, as I had trouble understanding the key signature and chord progressions due to the many accidentals.</p>

                    <h2>Title of Song</h2>
                    <p>This is a slower song which was mainly based off the middle section of another song I wrote. The file is over 3 minutes, but that is only because it loops the song. Out of the other songs here, this is the oldest.</p>

                    <h2>Title of Song</h2>
                    <p>This song is relativley recent. It mainly sticks to the same decending chord progression which I really like. I think this song has a similar feeling to the first song on this page, slightly chaotic. This is also the longest song out of the other songs here, and unlike the previous song, it doesn't even loop.</p>
