I told you not to for good reason, but now you have to suffer the consequences. I am forcing you to leave this webpage. If you choose to comeback, you can either be respectful of me and follow the rules, or choose to once again break the rules and be prompted with this same discouraging message, and the same shameful consequences. I hope you have learned something valuable from this experience. Sayonara.");
