    <h2>My Bio</h2>
    <!--Add image (of self i think)-->
    <p>Hi! I'm Matthew. I was born in California, but moved to Maryland around 2nd grade. I have 3 older siblings who all live in different states. In high school, I grew a large interest in music and music theory. I might want to do something regarding music in the future, but for now I'm sticking with game design and development since I'm more comfertable with that.</p>
    <p>I am majoring in VGDD, and will probably continue with VGD, but I haven't decided yet. I have had an interest in coding probably since middle school, but I've been playing video games for as long as I can remember. I mainly enjoy most Nintendo games aswell as a few others such as Minecraft.</p> <!--Bio good enough?-->
