                    <h2>Waltz</h2>
                    <p>This is the most recent song I've written. It uses a descending chord progression. It is in a minor key, yet most of the chords are actually major. I really like the melody to this one, to me it feels like a lullaby. Also, despite it's length, I still feel this song should have been a bit longer.</p>

                    <h2>Paper</h2>
                    <p>This is a slower song which was mainly based off the middle section of another song I wrote. The file is over 3 minutes, but that is only because it loops the song. Out of the other songs here, this is the oldest.</p>

                    <h2>Descend</h2>
                    <p>This song is relativley recent. It mainly sticks to the same descending chord progression which I really like. I think this song has a similar feeling to the next song on this page, slightly chaotic.</p>

                    <h2>Carnival</h2>
                    <p>This song is relativley quick and a bit chaotic. I'm most proud of the bass piano part and the slightly unstable feeling I managed to generate. The making of this song was interesting, as I had trouble understanding the key signature and chord progressions due to the many accidentals.</p>
